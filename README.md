# Kotlin sub project
 Collection of my mini sub project for fututre refrences. Some project is list based on main component which made up what i felt important during development process

## Project List
### Data Binding (Basic)
**[User Info](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Data%20Binding%20(Basic)/UserInfoDataBinding)**  
User Info app will view user data using data binding method. The data can be change using next and previous button.The goals of this app was to teach me basic concept of data binding

### View Model + Live Data
**[Match Score Counter](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Live%20data%20%2B%20View%20Model/MatchScoreCounterLiveDataViewModel)**  
Match Score Counter is where help user to count score mark. So, it very simple app which use View Model with Live Data with binding method. The reason we using View Model is to avoid lost data during confoguration change. There are may way for configuration change to occur which when screen oriented, language change, keyboard chang and etc. I also make sure that the screen show better placement of object when screen change to landscape mode, that why i have 2 layout for one activity
