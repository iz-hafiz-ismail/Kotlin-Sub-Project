# Kotlin sub project
 Collection of my mini sub project for future refrences. Some project is list based on main component which I feel important during development process

## Project List
### Data Binding (Basic)
- **[User Info](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Data%20Binding%20(Basic)/UserInfoDataBinding)**  
User Info app will view user data using data binding method. The data can be change using next and previous button.The goals of this app was to teach me basic concept of data binding
- **[Account List](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Data%20Binding%20(Basic)/AccountListRecyclerView)**<br>
Account List is an app where it list out all account. We can add account by clicking add button(account randomly generated with unique id). Account data will be shown in recycler view. If user click on account data list, the data will be delete based on account that has been click.

### View Model + Live Data
- **[Match Score Counter](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Live%20data%20%2B%20View%20Model/MatchScoreCounterLiveDataViewModel)**  
Match Score Counter was an app where it help user to count score mark. It is a very simple app which use View Model and Live Data with data binding method.

### Navigation Component Architecture
- **[Setting Navigation](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Navigation%20Component%20Architecture/SettingInterfaceNavigationArchitectureComponent)**  
Setting Navigation is simple app to view profile in setting. Actually, it was my mistake for putting wrong name ;). So, this app was to help me learning how to use Navigation Architecture Component where as using single activity with multiple fragment.

### Room with Coroutine
- **[Account List Plus](https://github.com/iz-hafiz/Kotlin-sub-project/tree/main/Room/AccountListPlusRoom)**  
Account List plus is an app where it list out all account with some improvement. Now we can create account and save on local. Account data can be retrieved even apps is killed and will be shown in recycler view. We will be using Room and Flow to save and emit data. We doesn't replace it completely as at the end of the day, we still need convert it to Live data again to display. Throught this project we also learn interaction of data from database with view from start to end.
